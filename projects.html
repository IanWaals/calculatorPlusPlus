                <h2>Calculator++</h2>
                <h4>Web development</h4>
                for this project we have to make a web page with a calculator made with HTML, CSS, and PHP. Also we had to include a homepage, a projects page (you are here at the moment) and a contact page.<br><br>

                <h2>Mystery Number</h2>
                <h4>Application programming</h4>
                for this project we had to make a game where you have to guess a random number, where a trackbar shows you how close your last answer was, and a progressbar tells you have many attempts you have left.<br><br>

                <h4>Embedded systems</h4>
                for this project we had to make a certain amounts of lights burn based on the temperature read by the temperature meter. These temperatures would only be in range when the meter would be held between fingers.<br><br>
